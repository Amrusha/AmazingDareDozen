# AmazingDareDozen

This is a flash game entirely written in c++.
The game contains baskets and eggs. The player is expected to transfer eggs from one basket to another without breaking the eggs.
The player wins the game when the egg reaches the last basket in 5th level and loses the game when all 12 eggs are lost/broken.

The folder contains 9 cpp files. Each contains code for each level and the main file which is to be run.
